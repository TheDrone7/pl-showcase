The following code defines a factorial that calculates the factorial of the number 'n' provided as it's parameter. For example, the factorial of 6 is being calculated.
```
(define (factorial n a)
    (display (if (= (dup n) 0) (dup a) "")) 
    (if (> (dup n) 0) (factorial (- (dup n) 1) (* n a)) (begin n a factorial)))

(factorial 6)
```
