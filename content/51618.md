# The following program prints all numbers between 1 and 100 that are prime

# First we define a function named 'isPrime' that checks if a number is prime or not (returns a boolean value - true or false)

isPrime = with n do:
    if n == 2:
        return true
    elif n > 1:
        for i in [2..(n / 2)]:
            if n % i == 0:
                return false
        return true
    else:
        return false

# Then we use the function to filter a range list
# log is a built in function being called using the '<-' operator.
# [1..100] generates a list of all numbers between 1 and 100.
# The '\\' operator specifies that the list is to be filtered and then specifies the function to be used for filtering the numbers, in this case, the 'isPrime' function.
log <- [1..100]'0 \\ isPrime
