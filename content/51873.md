The following program calculates 5's factorial.

Functions are declared the same way as variables, i.e. using the `let` keyword.

Codeblocks are enclosed within `{...}` and the last statement should not end with a semi-colon (`;`) for it to return the value.

The conditional statements are the same as any traditional programming language of the format `if (condition) {...} else {...}`
```
{
	let factorial = function(x) {
		if (x == 0) {
			1
		} else {
			x * (factorial(x - 1))
		}
	};
	factorial(5)
}
```
