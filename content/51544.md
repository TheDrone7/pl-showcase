  This is a comment and will be used to explain the code.
  This code will calculate the factorial of the 5.
<#

# The require statements import packages. Here the "stdio" and "list" packages are being imported from the standard library.
require "stdio" 
require "list"

# Define variables n - the number whose factorial is to be calculated and o - The result.

n = 5
o = 1

# Loop from 1 to n + 1, end-exclusive
for List:Range(1, n + 1) { 
  o = o * _ # Multiply the output by the current value (which is being accessed using _)
}

# Write the result using the writeln function from the stdio package.
Stdio:writeln("The factorial of " + n.__as_str() + " is " + o.__as_str())
