InMuse is for making music, the following piece of code, creates a tune for the famous lullaby **"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"**.

The first 2 lines define 2 named sequences (tracks). Each sequence is a series of notes. Each note is made of 3 characters, each implying the timing, pitch and octave respectively. The `repeat` function simply repeats a sequence `n` times, in the format `repeat(n, sequence)`.
The `midi` command is used to generate a midi file for you to listen to. The first parameter for the midi command is the filename, optionally followed by a MIDI instrument and/or the tempo then followed by (required) tracks or sequences.
```
twinkle = 4G4 4G4 4D5 4D5 4E5 4E5 2D5 ;
harmony = repeat(2, 2C3.maj(III) 2C3.maj(IV+)) ;

midi @'twinkle' #140 'cello' twinkle | harmony ;
