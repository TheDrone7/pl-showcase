// This is a comment and will be used to explain various things.
// The following code uses loops to generate the first 10 terms of the fibonacci series.

// Declare 3 variables, an array containing the terms and a number containing the number of terms to be calculated.
// And the last one to hold the value for the next term
set history = [0, 1, 1]
set num = 10
set nextterm = null

// Loop for the value of i from 2 to the above specified number of terms.
// Calculate the next term and push it to the array of terms.
loop 2 < i < num ^ 1 {
    nextterm = history[i] + history [i - 1]
    push(history, nextterm)
}

// Display the result
print(history)
