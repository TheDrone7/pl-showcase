# Declare a constant named 'num' and assign the value 5 to it.
const num = 5;

# Declate a variable named 'o' and assign the value 1 to it.
let o = 1;

# Loop over the values of i from 1 to num + 1 (excluding the last value)
for i = 1 until (num + 1) do
    o = o * i
end

# Print the result to the console.
log(o)
