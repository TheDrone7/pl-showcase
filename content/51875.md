; This is a comment and will be used to explain things in the program.

; the const keyword can be used to declare constants throughout the program.
const hello = "Hello World!"

; The function _start acts as the entry point for the program.
; The first two statements are for manipulating the registers rsi and rdx.
; The call statement can be used to call functions. The last statements in functions are automatically returned.
extern fn _start {
    $rsi = hello
    $rdx = sizeof(hello)
    call(print)
}

; For asm features that aski does not support at the moment, you can directly use asm commands.
; For using asm commands, just start the statement with a hashtag (`#`)
fn print {
    $rax = 1
    $rdi = 1
    #syscall
}
