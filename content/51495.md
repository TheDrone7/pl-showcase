; This is a comment and will be used to explain things.
; The following program gets a numerical input from the user and calculates its factorial.
; The hashtag is one of the keywords used to declare variables. It indicates the variable will be either an integer or null.
# factorial = 1

; get() is a built-in function to get user input. The `#` indicates the user should input an integer.
# n = get()

; This is a for loop that loops for the value of i starting from 1 to n + 1 (excluding the last value).
@ i 1|n+1
    factorial = factorial * i

; The write function can be used to show output.
write(factorial)
