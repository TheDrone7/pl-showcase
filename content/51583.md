// The program contains of 3 sections - Include, Tokens, Productions

// Include section defines what is to be included in the transpiled code.
Include {

// The tokens section specifies the togens that can be extracted by the lexer.
Tokens {

// Productions define the flow of the parser.
Productions {
	// Uses ε to allow the other production to either exist or not. Similar to the ? in regex

	// Uses the any number to define a production that should be run one or more times. Similar to + in regex
