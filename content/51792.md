// This is a comment and will be used to explain stuff.
// The following program calculates the factorial of the number 5 and displays it on the console.

// It is achieved recursively by using a function called 'factorial' that takes a parameter 'n' of the type 'Int'
let factorial = (Int n) => {
    if n <= 1 => return n
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
}

// Next we declare a variable o containing the result.
let o = factorial 5

// And finally we print the result.
print o
