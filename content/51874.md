The following program makes the client render a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) component that displays the text - **Hello World**. The [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) component calls the server-side function (defined using the `defs` keyword) `server-function` which runs on the server and returns the string value **"This function ran on the server"** which in turn is logged on the client-side console.
```
(defs server-function []
  "This function ran on the server.")
 
(defn app []
  (server-function #((.-log js/console) (:body %)))
  "Hello World")
```
